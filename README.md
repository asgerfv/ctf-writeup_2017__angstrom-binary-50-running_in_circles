# CTF Writeup 2017 :: Angstrom, Binary, 50, RUNNING IN CIRCLES
A fun little beginner CTF which I did in April.


# Original Description

RUNNING IN CIRCLES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BINARY, 50

Our data input program was vulnerable to overflows, so we fixed that by implementing a circular buffer. Now it should be totally secure! See if you can prove us wrong and get the flag on our shell sever. The problem is available as: binary and source.
